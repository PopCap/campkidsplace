        <h1>Day by Day at Camp</h1>
        <div id="dayInfo">
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">When is it? </span>There are eight weeks of camp in July and August for kids
                entering kindergarten through seventh grade in the fall.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">How are campers divided? </span>
                Campers are divided into six teams by age groups and gender, although many activities are campwide
                where everyone participates as a group with their counselors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">Where is the camp? </span> Camp Kids Place is based at the campus of Cherrydale
                Baptist Church in Arlington, Va., at the corner of Lorcom Lane and Military Road. We’re just a few minutes from Georgetown,
                Ballston, the Pentagon, and the National Mall. We occasionally travel to nearby swimming facilities, parks, and other
                places where campers are well-supervised as they participate in great activities. If campers are off-campus with us you
                can be assured they are as safe and well-protected as if they were at the camp facility.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">Who directs the camp? </span> The camp is presented by Cherrydale Baptist Church. Director Mitchell
                Downing has worked at Camp Kids Place for 10 years and as Assistant Director for 3 years and he is looking forward to his
                second summer as Director! You'll love our staff. They're carefully selected, vetted, and trained to keep your child safe,
                handle emergencies, and give your camper the best day you could ever imagine.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">How long is the camp day? </span> A basic day at camp is from 9am until 4pm. You can arrive 15 minutes
                earlier or stay 15 minutes later at no additional cost.  We suggest you check-in by 8:50am to get your camper to the Team
                Meeting on time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader"> But I need to be at work before 8:45am and I'll never make back it to pick up my child by 4:15pm. </span>
                We've got you covered! The optional Early Show is for kids who arrive between 7:15 and 8:45am, and the Late Show is for kids who leave
                between 4:15 and 5:45pm. Note that this is a Day Camp, not daycare. We encourage campers to be here for the entire day and for the entire
                week so they won’t miss anything!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">Who can come? </span> Attendance at Camp Kids Place is open to all kids from all backgrounds. Please remember
                that Camp Kids Place is a Christian camp that teaches biblical principles to our campers. Participation in the camp is a privilege, not a right.
                In order to participate in camp, children must be able to successfully function in a large-group community setting. While all children make mistakes
                while growing up, for the safety of our campers we cannot accommodate children who cannot or will not properly relate to authority, who fail to show
                respect for equipment, the facility, and for other campers, or will not submit themselves to camp rules and policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">What about lunch? </span> Campers bring their lunch each day. Snacks (including lots of healthy ones) and beverages are
                available for purchase at the Filling Station. And yes, we do sell candy and other things like that, but parents can put a limit on what their child
                can and cannot buy. If you say "no sugared sodas or candy," we'll direct your young shopper to other selections. You’ll make refundable deposits to
                your camper’s Filling Station snack shop account balances so your child won’t lose money at camp. We post a listing of account balances online each
                afternoon. To receive a refund of unspent Filling Station refunds, you must request the refund at the check-in table on your child's last day at camp.
                Funds not requested by then are automatically transferred to our scholarship fund for campers who need financial aid to come to camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">What else would you like me to know? </span> This website represents the official policies of the camp. As camp time approaches
                please read each page of this website as it contains specific information that is a part of how we do camp. Late minute additions can be found here as
                well. These pages explain our policies and most everything you’ll need to know.  As a Religiously operated day camp, Camp Kids Place is not licensed by
                the Commonwealth of Virginia, but is registered with the state and meets or exceeds all requirements and standards. In other words, we do camp right!
                Have more questions? Just give us a call at (703) 389-4012.
