            <p>
                Joining the camp staff is a great way to spend your summer. In addition to working hard every day with
                your friends - doing things that are lots of fun - you’ll become an important part of a child’s life
                and your contribution will be part of the success of the camp.
            </p>
            <h3>Volunteering at Camp Kids Place</h3>
            <p>
                Volunteers as young as those just having finished seventh grade can help as assistants on the Activity Staff,
                doing various things at camp that need to be done well to make everything a success. They also help with
                activities and games. In addition, some volunteers are high school or college students or other adults who
                just want to help without being paid. Although we can only accept a limited number of volunteers and we have
                many more applications from potential volunteers than we have room for, we may have a place for you and you
                may be just the person we're looking for.
            </p>
            <h3>Working on our Paid Staff</h3>
            <p>
                Others on our staff are paid for their work as they spend their summer in a great ministry job. The pay is
                comparable to what you would make at other temporary summer jobs. Working at camp, however, is much more
                than just a summer job. It's a chance to impact kids while serving with friends. Camp Kids Place is a
                Christian camp. We are looking for staff members who have trusted Jesus Christ as Savior and are committed
                to living a life as a follower of Him. Do not apply unless you are active in your local church or in a
                Christian group (such as InterVarsity or Cru) on your college campus. Nobody, of course, is perfect. But
                we want staff who are committed to loving God and loving people.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">There are several paid positions at Camp Kids Place... </span> We have six
                teams, (3 girls and 3 boys teams) each requiring a Head Counselor and Regular Counselors, Activity Leaders
                for the Gym, Craft Shop, and Spark Lab, and administrative workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">Head Counselors </span> work with the director part time between February
                and June to shape and plan each week and day of camp. Once the summer begins, head counselors begin to
                receive full-time pay. This position is only available to people who are able to commit to a minimum of
                1 monthly leadership team meeting (with the director, the other head counselors, and the 3 Activity
                Leaders) starting in March AND are able to work a minimum of SIX weeks at Camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">Activity Leaders </span> , like a Head Counselor, are responsible for the
                development and curriculum for either the Gym, the Craft Shop, or the Spark Lab. These areas are visited
                by each team daily and the Activity Leaders work alongside the director and head counselors throughout the
                spring and summer to develop a weekly and daily program for Camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">Administrative workers </span> manage communication with parents, forms and
                data analysis, and finances and work directly with the director on behind-the-scenes logistics during the
                camp summer season (June-late August).
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the above positions is similarly valuable to an internship with part-time, paid employment for a
                portion of the year, curriculum planning, and guided autonomy in shaping your teams and activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">If you are interested in one of the above positions </span> please email us
                or call us at (703) 389-4012. Applications for these positions are only available by request.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">Counselors </span> are directly responsible to their team's head counselor.  A Camp
                Kids Place counselor develops relationships with their campers, helps shape a team's spirit, vision, and goals,
                creates and executes unique activities, and sometimes are involved in pre-summer filming for thematic skits and
                weekly storylines for each of the 8 weeks of camp. Being a Camp Kids Place counselor is one of the most
                rewarding jobs you will ever have and will give you experiences that you can carry into any future work
                environment. Many of our workers have gone on to be highly successful in several areas and come back to work at
                camp year after year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Camp Kids Place prides itself on having the best staff in town and it is our commitment and passion that sets us
                apart from any other summer camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                Camp meets every weekday, July 1 - August 23 (except July 4th & 5th). We prefer workers who can be with us all
                summer. But if you’re not available the entire time, the more weeks you can join us the more likely we will find
                a place for you on our staff and the better job you can do for your campers and for the camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, there is mandatory Training/Orientation June 17th-19th.  Over the course of these three days you
                will be taught all that you need to know as a Camp Kids Place Staff Member.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are unable to attend this three day training session because of school (this is the only excusable reason
                for not attending training during this time, please contact me if you have questions), you may attend our weekend
                training sessions taking place on June 20th and 21st.  These condensed sessions will contain the same information
                as the sessions June 17th - 19th but will be longer to accomodate the information.
            </p>
            <p>
                THIS IS NOT TO BE MISTAKEN TO MEAN "CHOOSE THE OPTION YOU MOST PREFER", AS THE WEEKEND TRAINING SHOULD BE
                CONSIDERED MAKE-UP TRAINING FOR THOSE UNABLE TO ATTEND REGULAR TRAINING.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">During camp </span> , workers meet promptly at 8:15am for the daily staff
                meeting and stay until 4:30pm. In addition, paid staff members work at one Early or Late Show each week,
                either arriving at 7:10am or staying until 5:50pm. You will be paid on an hourly scale, including being
                paid during lunch.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="inlineHeader">To be considered for our staff </span> (whether as a volunteer or a
                paid worker), you’ll need to complete the online application below. If you are under 18, your parents are
                required to read over what you have written and digitally sign your application.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application asks for lots of information, so you’ll want to look it over and make sure you have
                everything you’ll need to complete your application, as everything must be filled in at one sitting.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a great opportunity to be a part of something really amazing. We promise to treat you with
                respect, provide what you need to succeed, and give you lots of opportunities to do things that really
                matter in the lives of kids.
            </p>
            <p>
                So think and pray about it and give us a call if you want to know more before you proceed. We’ll look
                forward to hearing from you.
            </p>
