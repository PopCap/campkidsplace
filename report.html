    <h1>Project 1 Report - Matthew Foley CS 347</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.
            </p>
            <p>
                My clients are Mitchell Downing and Charlie Jackson, Director and Assistant-Director of Camp Kids Place LLC.
                While excited about a website facelift, they were slow to responding to any requests I made to them, and so
                did not receive all assets and content I wanted for this project. They did request that each page from the
                original site remain so that's why I reused the all the text they already provided.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided you adhere to their license.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any images I used were either provided by my clients, pulled from their website, or are royalty free. Textual
                content on my website is taken from the information provided on the current website for Camp Kids Place. I
                reformatted it and did not just copy the html from the existing page.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html, which Apache loads by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                My site currently has 8 pages. The home page is index.html.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must include some sort of header.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each page has a header with navigation bar.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must include some sort of navigation links.
            </p>
            <p>
                Navigation links in the header.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens.

            </p>
            <p>
                The website already had a single column layout for the pages, however @media formatting was used to get more
                use out of smaller mobile screens.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate stylesheets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pretty standardized theme across all pages. Didn't have time to reformat site's global css file into individualized files for each page.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
            </p>
            <p>
                All images have alt attribute. Each page technically has an image because of the logo in the header. Most images
                in slideshow on homepage.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Each page must declare its favicon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Favicon registered on each page.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. JavaScript must be placed in a directory named js.
            </p>
            <p>
                All non-HTML resources in respected folders.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                No libraries or frameworks used. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is original.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu Validator.

            </p>
            <p>
                All pages passed validation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.
            <p>
                Left alignment used in all situations except navbar links and mobile formatting for banner text on homepage.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of 3 fonts across site. Header Navigation Links, headers, and plain text all have own font.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must include at least one form (or informal collection of input elements). The form might submit data to a server or invoke some client-side JavaScript function that alters the page. The action is not specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                Form used on registration page. Form inputs determine number of forms generated to be filled based on number
                of campers being registered at same time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must include links to external sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a link to the affiliated church (Cherrydale Baptist Church) on the home page.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Source code is readible. Id's are used for individualized styling, classes for anything repeated.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Site has two animations. The loading screen for the homepage, and the scrolling photowall on the
                homepage.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, share with the user twodee.

                The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                No uppercase letters in any file names. Only non-alphanumeric characters are in the names of images
                used. I downloaded them with that name and I don't feel it efficient use of time to rename all of them.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="req">
                Your site must have its own domain name.

            <p class="req">
                Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and pushing should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Have been committing since beginning of project assignment. Pushes were less frequent I believe.
