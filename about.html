                Camp Kids Place provides the perfect combination of fun, adventure and Christian character training. It’s for both guys and girls who will
                enter kindergarten (and are already at least five years old) through those entering 7th grade in the fall.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are lots of activities for everyone, with something for each interest and age. Campers play our famous “Carpet Ball,” enjoy our electronic
                race cars, slide down the giant dual-lane waterslide and enjoy other outside adventures at Kids Place Station (such as our ga-ga ball competition),
                meet for activities at the gym, join their team for great competition, participate in non-sectarian kid-friendly Bible activities, do those crazy
                camp things kids love, and enjoy appropriate video games with their friends. That’s also “The Filling Station,” our snack shop where kids can spend
                time with friends while they enjoy lunch or a snack. (Campers bring a lunch, but snacks and beverages are available for purchase.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Camp Kids Place offers everything from all-camp activities to team projects, the exciting "Spark Lab" where campers enjoy everything from virtual
                reality games to building projects to Legos to chess and board games and the greatest "brain games" you've ever seen, and of course there are sports
                and swimming with lots of activities for athletes of all ages and abilities. Kids enjoy creating something amazing in the Craft Shop they can take
                home, with special crafts for older kids, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Camp is not “too hard” for little kids while being “totally awesome” for older campers. Your kids won't believe how much fun they'll have!
            </p>

                Our Counselors are High-School through College aged students who go through rigorous training and an application and interview process to
                become summer staff.  We do background checks on all of our staff and all staff must go through health screenings to ensure they are able
                to provide child-care.
